# Introductory post

Hello and welcome to my Gemini capsule! 

I am blu.256 and I'm to be your host for tonight (just kidding). My interests revolve around technology, sciences (most of them), philosophy, software freedom, mass media and many other topics.

There is an Atom feed you can subscribe to and a Greek sub-gemlog coming soon!
