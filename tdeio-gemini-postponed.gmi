# tdeio-gemini postponed

As you may already know, I have started to work on adding Gemini protocol support for the Trinity Desktop, and Konqueror in particular.

The state of affairs with tdeio-gemini is this:

* Most existing bugs have been solved. The experience is pretty stable (at least for me ;-).
* Konqueror provides for us nice things like bookmarks and an "Up" button.
* Local files are also supported.

Current problems are:

* Input support is not ready yet. This is because it turned out we cannot create a GUI through a TDEIO process, so an internal "helper" application of some sorts will have to be creted to this end.
* Client certificates are not supported yet either. While the infrastructure seems to be in place, I still haven't figured out how to implement this.
* Some Unicode ranges are not supported by the GUI toolkit (namely TQt), and thus they don't work in tdeio-gemini.

These problems, as well as my taking interest in several TDE menu issues, will probably mean postponing the release of tdeio-gemini 1.0.

Also, I have begun assembling a list with things to include in a next 1.1 release. For now it's a settings dialog with customization options, but if you get a cool idea don't hesitate to come in touch with me!
